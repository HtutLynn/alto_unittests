1. Use a TensorRT model with batch image data input
   - head_yolov5_4.trt model is TensorRT model which accepts 4 x Height x Width as input
   - better preprocessing function
   - better postprocessing function - c++ plugins

2. create_region_be_view Function
   1. Instead of passing image paths and reading again, passing already-read image data is much more efficient
   2. Check if padding the cameras frames is required or not since padding operation takes some time

3. Try training the model with smaller image dimensions and more data
   Because currently, inference time is affected mainly by input data size.
   Current model input dimensions : 1024 
   Potentials : 720, x, x
   More data : brainwash dataset is added so needs to retrain for better accuracy
